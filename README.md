# Sketchy

A repository example for helping designers' workflow by having some helpful exports while using version control.
*Note: This example uses sketch, and is highly opinionated*

## Prerequisite

0. Clone this repository.

1. You should have Sketch (only for Mac :apple: ) installed.

2. Install sketch's CLI called sketchtool using the following commands on the Terminal:

``` 
sudo /Users/<enter your username>/Downloads/Sketch.app/Contents/Resources/sketchtool/install.sh
```
Get Nodejs Up and running on your machine as shown in this [link](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html)

3. Run ``` npm install ``` on the root of this directory.

4. Use the given file index.sketch as the file you design and version and export for.

## Workflow

1. Edit ``` index.sketch ``` and commit the changes after you are done with it.

2. After you commit, a script runs on your machine which generates the export for your sketch file, commit that too! :fire:

3. Voila you are done! :rocket:
